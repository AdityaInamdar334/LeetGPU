## K-Means Clustering (C++)

This section details a C++ implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.

**What is K-Means Clustering?**

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group a set of data points into `k` distinct clusters. The algorithm works by iteratively assigning each data point to the cluster whose centroid (mean) is closest to it. The goal is to minimize the within-cluster variance, meaning data points within the same cluster should be as similar to each other as possible, while being dissimilar to data points in other clusters.

**The Theory Behind It (Simplified!)**

Imagine you have a bunch of dots scattered on a piece of paper, and you want to group them into a few distinct groups. K-Means tries to do this automatically. Here's the basic idea:

1.  **Pick Some Centers (Initialization):** First, you decide how many groups (clusters) you want, let's say `k`. Then, you randomly pick `k` points from your data to be the initial "centers" of these groups. These centers are called centroids.

2.  **Assign the Dots (Assignment Step):** Now, for every single dot on the paper, you figure out which of the initial centers it's closest to. You then say that this dot "belongs" to that center's group. We usually use the regular straight-line distance (Euclidean distance) to figure out closeness.

3.  **Move the Centers (Update Step):** After you've assigned all the dots to groups, you look at each group and find the average position of all the dots in that group. This average position becomes the new center (centroid) for that group. It's like the center tries to move to the middle of its group.

4.  **Repeat!:** You keep repeating steps 2 and 3. You re-assign all the dots to the nearest new center, and then you recalculate the centers based on the new groups. You do this over and over again until the centers don't move much anymore, or until you've done it a certain number of times.

**How the C++ Code Works**

Our C++ implementation has a `KMeans` class that does all this for you:

* **`k_`:** This variable stores the number of clusters you want to find.
* **`max_iterations_`:** This sets a limit on how many times the algorithm will repeat the "assign and move" steps. This is to make sure it finishes eventually.
* **`centroids_`:** This will store the coordinates of the center of each cluster after the algorithm is done.
* **`cluster_assignments_`:** This will tell you which cluster each of your original data points belongs to (it's just a list of numbers, where each number corresponds to a cluster index).

The main work happens in the `fit` method. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Initialization (`initialize_centroids`):** It randomly picks `k` data points from your input data to be the starting centroids.
2.  **Iteration:** It loops up to `max_iterations_` times. In each iteration:
    * **Assignment:** For every data point, it calculates the distance to each centroid using the `euclidean_distance` function. It then assigns the data point to the cluster of the nearest centroid.
    * **Update:** It calculates the new position of each centroid by taking the average of all the data points that are currently assigned to it.
    * **Convergence Check:** It checks if the centroids have moved significantly since the last iteration. If they haven't, it means the algorithm has found a good clustering, and it can stop early.

The `get_cluster_assignments` method lets you get the final cluster labels for each data point, and `get_centroids` gives you the coordinates of the final cluster centers.

**How to Use the Code**

To use this `KMeans` class, you'll need to:

1.  Include the necessary headers (`iostream`, `vector`, `cmath`, `limits`, `random`, `algorithm`).
2.  Create an instance of the `KMeans` class, specifying the number of clusters you want (and optionally the maximum number of iterations).
3.  Provide your data as a vector of vectors (where each inner vector is a data point) to the `fit` method.
4.  After the `fit` method finishes, you can use `get_cluster_assignments` to see which cluster each data point belongs to and `get_centroids` to see the final cluster centers.

Check out the `main` function in the code for a simple example of how to use it.

**Important Things to Keep in Mind**

* **Choosing `k`:** You need to decide on the number of clusters (`k`) beforehand. This can sometimes be tricky and might require some experimentation or using other techniques.
* **Initial Centroids:** The initial random selection of centroids can sometimes affect the final clustering. Running the algorithm multiple times with different initializations might be a good idea.
* **Assumptions:** K-Means works best when the clusters are somewhat spherical (like balls) and have roughly the same size. It might not work so well for clusters with very irregular shapes.

This here implementation should give you a solid understanding of how the K-Means algorithm works and how you can implement it in C++. Its a pretty useful algorithm for lots of different tasks!
