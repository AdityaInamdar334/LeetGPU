# Simple Gradient Boosting Regressor

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Gradient Boosting Regressor in Python. It's designed to provide a clear understanding of how gradient boosting works for regression tasks.

## What is Gradient Boosting?

Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used for regression and classification tasks, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

* **Ensemble Method:** Gradient boosting combines multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong learner.
* **Sequential Learning:** Unlike random forests, which build trees in parallel, gradient boosting builds trees sequentially. Each subsequent tree corrects the errors of the previous trees.
* **Residuals:** Gradient boosting focuses on minimizing the residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values).
* **Gradient Descent:** The "gradient" in gradient boosting refers to the use of gradient descent to minimize the loss function. Each tree is trained to minimize the gradient of the loss function with respect to the current predictions.
* **Learning Rate:** A learning rate is used to scale the contribution of each tree. This helps prevent overfitting and allows for more fine-grained control over the learning process.

**How it works in this code:**

1.  **Initialization:** The model starts with an initial prediction, typically the mean of the target values.
2.  **Residual Calculation:** The residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values) are calculated.
3.  **Tree Building:** A decision tree is trained to predict the residuals.
4.  **Prediction Update:** The predictions are updated by adding the predictions of the new tree, scaled by the learning rate.
5.  **Iteration:** Steps 2-4 are repeated for a specified number of iterations (trees).
6.  **Final Prediction:** The final predictions are the sum of the initial prediction and the predictions of all the trees.

## Features

* **Basic Gradient Boosting Regression:** Implements the core logic of a gradient boosting regressor.
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Gradient:** Uses the gradient of MSE to determine the residuals.
* **Sequential Tree Building:** Builds trees sequentially to correct errors.
* **Learning Rate:** Includes a learning rate to control the contribution of each tree.
* **Clear and Commented Code:** Designed for readability and educational purposes.
* **Example Usage:** Includes an example using `make_regression` from scikit-learn.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* scikit-learn (for the example usage)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/adityainamdar334/simple-gradient-boosting-regressor.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://github.com/adityainamdar334/simple-gradient-boosting-regressor.git)
    cd simple-gradient-boosting-regressor
    ```

2.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

1.  Run the provided example:

    ```bash
    python gradient_boosting_regressor.py
    ```

    This will train a gradient boosting regressor on a generated regression dataset and print the mean squared error.

2.  You can also integrate the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class into your own projects:

    ```python
    from gradient_boosting_regressor import GradientBoostingRegressor
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    # Generate and split data
    X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=20, random_state=42)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train the gradient boosting regressor
    gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
    gbr.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = gbr.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate mean squared error
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
    ```
